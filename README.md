# Quiz Me

### Overview 

Test your general knowledge [here](https://ruthless-wish.surge.sh/)!

Quiz Me is an interactive trivia app that allows the user to choose from three difficulty levels - easy, medium, or hard. After the user chooses how spicy they want their quesitons to be, they are redirected to a page with 10 random questions from the API. After all 10 questions are answered, the user is able to click on the `submit` button to see how many questions they answered correctly. The results page also gives the user the option to `play again` which routes them to the home page to start the fun all over again.

### Learning Goals

After building several projects with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we are now working with the magic of React. This project challenged us to implement yet another technology of our choice through self-teaching and exploration. We decided to go with **React's Context API** so we could start working with global state management. Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
